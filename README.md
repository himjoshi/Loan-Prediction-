# Loan-Prediction-
This is my first classification project where we need to classify whether the person will get loan or not according to the different
perameters.
The training dataset contains 614 observations and 12 independent variables and the data is incomplete.
Data visualization is used to fill those missing values and different machine learning algorithms were trained on the training dataset.
